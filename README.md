# Better Go Utils

This is a small collection of utility types and functions for Go. I wrote these
because generics are available in Go but still not widespread. In the meantime
I thought I could trial some of these ideas in side projects and see if they
work well.

## Features

* Rust-like Option and Result types.
* Rust-like Into/From interfaces.
* Promises

## Caveats

* Not really optimized in any meaningful way.
* Still needs more tests & may have correctness issues.
